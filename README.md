# Smart-street-lights
Our project for developing a smart street light system is reviewed. In this project, the street light system, in which lights ON/OFF process is done without manual operation.
Currently, in the whole world, enormous electric energy is consumed by the street lamps, which are turn ON whole night and turn off when it is morning. This is the huge waste of energy in the whole world and should be changed. 
so we designed to lights turn on before pedestrians and vehicles come and turn off when they move out of the range to reduce power when there is no one and this system also uses solar energy in advance.
This project is totally sensors dependent and usefull development for future.
